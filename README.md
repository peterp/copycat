## Motivation

### The problem
Many of the use cases we aim to solve with [snaplet](https://snaplet.dev/) involves anonymizing sensitive information. In practice, this involves replacing each bit of sensitive data with something else that _resembles_ the original value, yet does not allow the original value to be inferred.

To do this, we initially turned to [faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) for replacing the sensitive data with fake data. This approach took us quite far. However, we struggled with getting the replacement data to be _deterministic_: we found we did not have enough control over how results are generated to be able to easily ensure that for each value of the original data we wanted to replace, we'd always get the same replacement value out.

Faker allows one to seed a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), such that the same sequence of values will be generated every time. While this means the sequence is deterministic, the problem was we did not have enough control over where the next value in the sequence was going to be used. Changes to the contents or structure in the original data we're replacing and changes to how we are using faker both had an effect on the way we used this sequence, which in turn had an effect on the resulting replacement value for any particular value in the original data. In other words, we had determinism, but not in a way that is useful for our purpose.

### The solution
What we were really needing was not the same _sequence_ of generated values every time, but the same _mapping_ to generated values every time.

This is exactly what we designed `Copycat` to do. For each method provided by Copycat, a given input value will always map to the same output value.

```js
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat'

copycat.email('foo')
// => 'Zakary.Block356@gmail.com'

copycat.email('bar')
// => 'Thurman.Schowalter668@hotmail.com'

copycat.email('foo')
// => 'Zakary.Block356@gmail.com'
```

Copycat works statelessly: for the same input, the same value will be returned regardless of the environment, process, call ordering, or any other external factors.

Under the hood, Copycat hashes the input values (in part relying on [md5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)), with the intention of making it computationally infeasible for the input values to be inferred from the output values.

### Alternative approaches

It is still technically possible to make use of faker or similar libraries that offer deterministic PRNG - with some modification. That said, these solutions came with practical limitations that we decided made them less viable for us:
* It is possible to simply seed the PRNG for every identifier, and then use it to generate only a single value. This seems to be a misuse of these libraries though: there is an up-front cost to seeding these PRNGs that can be expensive if done for each and every value to be generated. [Here are benchmarks](https://gist.github.com/justinvdm/eaae3a59c1a1790704db9674e1785afa) that point to this up-front cost.
* You can generate a sequence of N values, hash identifiers to some integer smaller than N, then simply use that as an index to lookup a value in the sequence. This can even be done lazily. Still, you're now limiting the uniqueness of the values to N. The larger N is, the larger the cost of keeping these sequences in memory, or the more computationally expensive it is if you do not hold onto the sequences in memory. The smaller N is, the less unique your generated values are.

Note though that for either of these approaches, hashing might also still be needed to make it infeasible for the inputs to be inferred from the outputs.

## API Reference
### Overview

<a name="input"></a>All Copycat functions take in an `input` value as their first parameter:

```js
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat'

copycat.email('foo')
// => 'Zakary.Block356@gmail.com'
```

The given input can be any JSON-serializable value. For any two calls to the same function, the input given in each call serializes down to the same value and the same output will be returned.

Note that unlike `JSON.stringify()`, object property ordering is not considered.

## Working with PII (Personal Identifiable Information)

If you're using sensitive information as input to Copycat, the fact that Copycat makes use of [md5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) means it is difficult for the original input value to be inferred from the output value - it is computationally infeasible.

```js
// It is difficult to reverse engineer 'Some sensitive input'
// from 'Rhianna Ebert'
copycat.fullName('Some sensitive input')
// => 'Rhianna Ebert'
```

That said, there is still something we need to watch out for: with enough guessing, the input values can still be figured out from the output values.

Lets say we replaced all the first names in some table of data. Included in this data was the name `'Susan'`, which was replaced with `'Therese'`:

```js
copycat.firstName('Susan') // -> 'Therese'
```

While the attacker is able to see the name `Therese`, it is difficult for them to look at Copycat's code, and figure out `'Susan'` from `'Therese'`. But the attacker knows they're dealing with first names, and they have access to the Copycat library. What they can do, is input a list of first names into Copycat, until they find a matching name.

Let's say they input the name `'John'`. The result is `'April'`, which does not match `'Therese'`, so they move on. They next try `'Sarah'`, which maps to `'Florencio'` - again no match, they move on. They next try `Susan`, which maps to the name they see - `Therese`. This means they have a match, and now know that the original name was `Susan`:

```js
copycat.firstName('John') // -> 'April', no match
copycat.firstName('Sarah') // -> 'Florencio', no match
copycat.firstName('Susan') // -> 'Therese', match!
```

To mitigate this, Copycat supports [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) with [`setSalt`](#set-salt) - additional data concatenated onto the input value before hashing:

```js
copycat.fullName('foo')
// => 'Blair Schaefer'

copycat.setSalt('something-else')

copycat.fullName('foo')
// => 'Rollin Bailey'
```

The idea is that while Copycat's code is publicly known, the salt isn't publically known. This means that even though attackers have access to Copycat's
code, they are not able to figure out which inputs map to which outputs, since they do not have access to the salt.

Ideally, one salt should be used per-value, rather than re-used for several values. If salt is re-used, an attacker can [pre-compute a table of results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table). In our example, a salt value can be chosen and used along with a list of names to pre-compute the corresponding output values.

### `faker`
